# Front End Challenge One - Accessibility
## Description


This project is to demonstrate my ability to read exisiting code (downloaded from the Skills for Life/EdX course) and assign it appropriate semantic tags to make it more accessible and optimised for search engines.
The requirements I am trying to follow are below and taken directly from the challenge's description:

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Installation
